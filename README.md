# Touch your left elbow (TensorJS demo)

Inspired by [this article written by TensorJS](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2021/05/next-generation-pose-detection-with-movenet-and-tensorflowjs.html)

I thought it would be cool to create a POC to see if I could use the app to see if a user was touching their left elbow right their right hand (wrist).
